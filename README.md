**NOTE: The Verus guide needs to be updated for the new version of Verus which does not rely on a fork of the rust compiler.**

Verus is a tool for verifying the correctness of code written in Rust.
Developers write specifications of what their code should do,
and Verus statically checks that the executable Rust code will always 
satisfy the specifications for all possible executions of the code.
Rather than adding run-time checks, Verus instead relies on powerful solvers to
prove the code is correct.  Verus currently supports a subset of Rust (which we
are working to expand), and in some cases, it allows developers to go beyond
the standard Rust type system and statically check the correctness of code
that, for example, manipulates raw pointers.
