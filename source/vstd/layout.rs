//
// I think it could go like this:
//   - Have some polymorphic code that constructs a giant tuple and proves false
//   - Make sure the code doesn't get monomorphized by rustc
//   - To export the 'false' fact from the polymorphic code without monomorphizing,
//     use broadcast_forall.
//
// Therefore, we are NOT creating an axiom that `size_of` fits in usize.
// However, we still give the guarantee that if you call `core::mem::size_of`
// at runtime, then the resulting usize is correct.
