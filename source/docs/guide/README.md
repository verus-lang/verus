# Requirements

To build the guide locally, you will need to install [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/).
The simplest approach is often to run `cargo install mdbook`.

# Building

To build the guide, run `mdbook serve`.  This will render the guide
and start a local webserver where you can view your updated guide.
