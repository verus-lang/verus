# Loops and invariants

The previous section developed a tail-recursive implementation of `triangle`:

```rust
{{#include ../../../rust_verify/example/guide/recursion.rs:tail}}
```

We can rewrite this as a `while` loop as follows:

```rust
{{#include ../../../rust_verify/example/guide/recursion.rs:loop}}
```

The loop is quite similar to the tail-recursive implementation.
(In fact, internally, Verus verifies the loop as if it were its own function,
separate from the enclosing `loop_triangle` function.)
Where the tail-recursive function had preconditions,
the loop has *loop invariants* that describe what must
be true before and after each iteration of the loop.
For example, if `n = 10`,
then the loop invariant must be true 11 times:
before each of the 10 iterations,
and after the final iteration.

Notice that the invariant `idx <= n` allows for the possibility that `idx == n`,
since this will be the case after the final iteration.
If we tried to write the invariant as `idx < n`,
then Verus would fail to prove that the invariant is maintained after the final iteration.

After the loop exits,
Verus knows that `idx <= n` (because of the loop invariant)
and it knows that the loop condition `idx < n` must have been false
(otherwise, the loop would have continued).
Putting these together allows Verus to prove that `idx == n` after exiting the loop.
Since we also have the invariant `sum == triangle(idx as nat)`,
Verus can then substitute `n` for `idx` to conclude `sum == triangle(n as nat)`,
which proves the postcondition of `loop_triangle`.

Just as verifying functions requires some programmer effort to write
appropriate preconditions and postconditions,
verifying loops requires programmer effort to write loop invariants.
The loop invariants have to be neither too weak (`invariant true` is usually too weak)
nor too strong (`invariant false` is too strong),
so that:
- the invariants hold upon the initial entry to the loop
  (e.g. `idx <= n` holds for the initial value `idx = 0`, since `0 <= n`)
- the invariant still holds at the end of the loop body,
  so that the invariant is maintained across loop iterations
- the invariant is strong enough to prove the properties we want
  to know after the loop exits (e.g. to prove `loop_triangle`'s postcondition)

As mentioned above,
Verus verifies the loop separately from the function that contains the loop
(e.g. separately from `loop_triangle`).
This means that the loop does not automatically inherit preconditions
like `triangle(n as nat) < 0x1_0000_0000` from the surrounding function ---
if the loop relies on these preconditions,
they must be listed explicitly in the loop invariants.
(The reason for this is to improve the efficiency of the SMT solving
for large functions with large while loops;
verification runs faster if Verus breaks the surrounding function and the loops into separate pieces
and verifies them modularly.)
