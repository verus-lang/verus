# Automatically producing a spec function for executable code 

When verifying code in Verus, it may be necessary to write spec functions that
have the exact same implementation as their corresponding executable functions.
This situation is common when the executable functions are small and purely
computational.

`#[verus_verify(dual_spec)]` simplies the process of writing a spec function for an
existing executable function. When applied to an executable function, it
automatically produces a corresponding spec function by:

1. Removing ghost variables and proof blocks from the executable function.
2. Generating a spec function with identical logic. By default, the spec
   function is given an internal name like _VERUS_SPEC_xxx. You can also specify
   a custom name using `#[verus_verify(dual_spec($custom_name))]`.
3. Applying the attribute [`#[when_used_as_spec]`](reference-attributes.html)
   to the executable function.  Thus, the actual spec function name does
   generally matter since the `when_used_as_spec` attribute allows you to use
   the executable functionâ€™s name directly as a spec function in proofs.

Here is an example:

```rust
{{#include ../../../../examples/guide/exec_attr.rs:dual_spec}}
```

## Limitations

`#[verus_verify(dual_spec)]` requires the use of `#[verus_spec(...)]`.  It
currently does not support executable functions verified via the `verus!`
macro. This is because the `verus_verify` macro expects to parse an exec
function in native Rust syntax, instead of in `verus!` syntax. Thus,
`#[verus_verify(dual_spec)]` should be used with `#[verus_spec(...)]` outside
of the `verus!` macro.

`dual_spec` tries to generate a spec function from an exec function, but it may
not be able to generate a valid spec function if the exec function uses
features that are not supported by spec functions.

For example, mutable inputs are not supported: 

```
fn f(x: &mut u32, y: u32) -> u32 {
    *x = *x + y;
    *x
}
```

If you use an unsupported feature, you should see the following error message:

```
The verifier does not yet support the following Rust feature
```


## Related

The `dual_spec` attribute creates a spec function for executable code, which
might not cover your use case.  For example, you may want to go from [spec to
exec code](exec_spec.html), or use the [`when_used_as_spec` attribute](reference-attributes.html).
