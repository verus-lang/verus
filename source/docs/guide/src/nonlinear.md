# Integers: Nonlinear Arithmetic

Generally speaking, Verus's default solver (Z3) is excellent at handling _linear_ integer arithmetic.
Linear arithmetic captures equalities, inequalities, addition, subtraction, and multiplication and division by _constants_.
This means it's great at handling expressions like `4 * x + 3 * y - z <= 20`. However, it is less capable
when _nonlinear_ expressions are involved, like `x * y` (when neither `x` nor `y` can be substituted for a constant)
or `x / y` (when `y` cannot be substituted for a constant).

That means many common axioms are inaccessible in the default mode, including but not limited to:

 * `x * y == y * x`
 * `x * (y * z) == (x * y) * z`
 * `x * (a + b) == x * a + x * b`
 * `0 <= x <= y && 0 <= z <= w ==> x * z <= y * w`

The reason for this limitation is that Verus _intentionally_ disables theories of nonlinear arithmetic in its default prover mode.

However, it is possible to **opt-in** to nonlinear reasoning by invoking a specialized prover mode.
There are two prover modes relative to nonlinear arithmetic.

 * `nonlinear_arith` - Enable Z3's nonlinear theory of arithmetic.
 * `integer_ring` - Enable Z3's nonlinear theory of arithmetic.

The first is general purpose, but unfortunately somewhat unpredicable. (This is why it is turned off by default.)
The second implements a decidable procedure for a specific class of problems.
Invoking either prover mode requires an understanding of how to _minimize prover context_.

## 1. Invoking a specialized solver: `nonlinear_arith`

A specialized solver is invoked with the `by` keyword, which can be applied to either
an `assert` statement or a `proof fn`. 

Here, we'll see how it works using the `nonlinear_arith` solver,
which enables [Z3's theory of nonlinear arithmetic for integers](https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/docs/theories/Arithmetic/#non-linear-arithmetic).

### Inline Proofs with `assert(...) by(nonlinear_arith)`
To prove a nonlinear property in the midst of a larger function,
you can write `assert(...) by(nonlinear_arith)`.  This creates
a separate Z3 query just to prove the asserted property,
and for this query, Z3 runs with its nonlinear heuristics enabled.
The query does NOT include ambient facts (e.g., knowledge that stems
from the surrounding function's `requires` clause or from preceding variable assignments)
other than that which is:

 * inferred from a variable's type (e.g., the allowed ranges of a `u64` or `nat`), or
 * supplied explicitly.

To supply context explicitly, you can use a `requires` clause, a shown below:

```rust
{{#include ../../../rust_verify/example/guide/nonlinear_bitvec.rs:bound_checking}}
```

Let's go through this example, one step at a time:

 * Verus uses its _normal solver_ to prove that assert's "requires" clause, that `x <= 10 && y <= 10`. This follows from the precondition of the function.
 * Verus uses Z3's _nonlinear solver_ to prove `x <= 10 && y <= 10 ==> x * y <= 100`. This would not be possible with the normal solver, but it is possible for the nonlinear solver.
 * The fact `x * y <= 100` is now provided in the proof context for later asserts.
 * Verus uses its _normal solver_ to prove that `x * y <= 1000`, which follows from
    `x * y <= 100`.

Furthermore, if you use a `by` clause, as in `assert ... by(nonlinear_arith) by { ... }`, then everything in the `by` clause will opt-in to the nonlinear solver.

### Reusable proofs with `proof fn ... by(nonlinear_arith)`

You can also use `by(nonlinear_arith)` in a proof function's signature. By including `by(nonlinear_arith)`, the query for this function runs with nonlinear arithmetic reasoning enabled. For example:

```rust
{{#include ../../../rust_verify/example/guide/nonlinear_bitvec.rs:bound_checking_func}}
```

When a specialized solver is invoked on a `proof fn` like this, it is used to prove the
lemma. When the lemma is then invoked from elsewhere, Verus (as usual) proves that the
precondition is met; for this it uses its normal solver.

## 2. Proving Ring-based Properties: `integer_ring`

While general nonlinear formulas cannot be solved consistently, certain
sub-classes of nonlinear formulas can be.  For example, nonlinear formulas that
consist of a series of congruence relations (i.e., equalities modulo some
divisor `n`).  As a simple example, we might like to show that `a % n == b % n
==> (a * c) % n == (b * c) % n`.

Verus offers a deterministic proof strategy to discharge such obligations.
The strategy is called `integer_ring`.

[_Note_: at present, it is only possible to invoke `integer_ring` using the
`proof fn ... by(integer_ring)` style; inline asserts are not supported.]


Verus will then discharge the proof obligation using a dedicated algebra solver
called [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/).  As hinted at by the
annotation, this proof technique is only complete (i.e., guaranteed to succeed)
for properties that are true for all
[rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)).   Formulas that rely
specifically on properties of the integers may not be solved successfully.

Using this proof technique requires a bit of additional configuration of your Verus installation.
See [installing and setting up Singular](./install-singular.md).

### Details/Limitations
- This can be used only with **int** parameters.
- Formulas that involve inequalities are not supported.   
- Division is not supported.
- Function calls in the formulas are treated as uninterpreted functions.  If a function definition is important for the proof, you should unfold the definition of the function in the proof function's `requires` clause.
- When using an `integer_ring` lemma, the divisor of a modulus operator (`%`) must not be zero. If a divisor can be zero in the ensures clause of the `integer_ring` lemma, the facts in the ensures clause will not be available in the callsite.

To understand what `integer_ring` can or cannot do, it is important to understand how it
handles the modulus operator, `%`. Since `integer_ring` does not understand inequalities,
it cannot perform reasoning that requires that `0 <= (a % b) < b`.
As a result, Singular's results might be confusing if you think of `%` primarily
as the operator you're familiar with from programming.

For example, suppose you use `a % b == x` as a precondition.
Encoded in Singular, this will become `a % b == x % b`, or in more traditional "mathematical"
language, `a ≡ x (mod b)`. This does _not_ imply that `x` is in the range `[0, b)`,
it only implies that `a` and `x` are in the same equivalence class mod b.
In other words, `a % b == x` implies `a ≡ x (mod b)`, but not vice versa.

For the same reason, you cannot ask the `integer_ring` solver to prove a postcondition
of the form `a % b == x`, unless `x` is 0. The `integer_ring` solver can prove
that `a ≡ x (mod b)`, equivalently `(a - x) % b == 0`, but this does _not_ imply
that `a % b == x`.

Let's look at a specific example to understand the limitation.

```rust
proof fn foo(a: int, b: int, c: int, d: int, x: int, y: int) by(integer_ring)
    requires
        a % b == x,
        c % d == y
    ensures
        x == y,
{
}
```

This theorem statement appears to be trivial, and indeed, Verus would solve it easily
using its default proof strategy. 
However, `integer_ring` will not solve it.
We can inspect the Singular query to understand why:
(See [here](#examining-the-encoding) for how to log these.)

```
ring ring_R=integer, (a, b, c, d, x, y, tmp_0, tmp_1, tmp_2), dp;
    ideal ideal_I =
      a - c,
      b - d,
      (a - (b * tmp_0)) - x,
      (c - (d * tmp_1)) - y;
    ideal ideal_G = groebner(ideal_I);
    reduce(x - y, ideal_G);
    quit;
```

We can see here that `a % b` is translated to `a - b * tmp_0`,
while `c % d` is translated to `c - d * tmp_1`.
Again, since there is no constraint that `a - b * tmp_0` or `c - d * tmp_1`
is bounded, it is not possible to conclude 
that `a - b * tmp_0 == c - d * tmp_1` after this simplification has taken place.

## 3. Combining `integer_ring` and `nonlinear_arith`.

As explained above, the `integer_ring` feature has several limitations, it is not possible to get an arbitary nonlinear property only with the `integer_ring` feature. Instead, it is a common pattern to have a `by(nonlinear_arith)` function as a main lemma for the desired property, and use `integer_ring` lemma as a helper lemma.

To work around the lack of support for inequalities and division, you can often write a helper proof discharged with `integer_ring` and use it to prove properties that are not directly supported by `integer_ring`. Furthermore, you can also add additional variables to the formulas. For example, to work around division, one can introduce `c` where `b = a * c`, instead of `b/a`.

#### Example 1: `integer_ring` as a helper lemma to provide facts on modular arithmetic
In the `lemma_mod_difference_equal` function below, we have four inequalities inside the requires clauses, which cannot be encoded into `integer_ring`. In the ensures clause, we want to prove `y % d - x % d == y - x`. The helper lemma `lemma_mod_difference_equal_helper` simply provides that `y % d - x % d` is equal to `(y - x)` modulo `d`. The rest of the proof is done by `by(nonlinear_arith)`.

```rust
pub proof fn lemma_mod_difference_equal_helper(x: int, y:int, d:int, small_x:int, small_y:int, tmp1:int, tmp2:int) by(integer_ring)
    requires
        small_x == x % d,
        small_y == y % d,
        tmp1 == (small_y - small_x) % d,
        tmp2 == (y - x) % d,
    ensures
        (tmp1 - tmp2) % d == 0
{}
pub proof fn lemma_mod_difference_equal(x: int, y: int, d: int) by(nonlinear_arith)
    requires
        d > 0,
        x <= y,
        x % d <= y % d,
        y - x < d
    ensures
        y % d - x % d == y - x
{
    let small_x = x % d;
    let small_y = y % d;
    let tmp1 = (small_y - small_x) % d;
    let tmp2 = (y - x) % d;
    lemma_mod_difference_equal_helper(x,y,d, small_x, small_y, tmp1, tmp2);
}
```

In the `lemma_mod_between` function below, we want to prove that `x % d <= z % d < y % d`. However, `integer_ring` only supports equalities, so we cannot prove `lemma_mod_between` directly. Instead, we provide facts that can help assist the proof. The helper lemma provides 1) `x % d - y % d == x - y  (mod d)` and 2) ` y % d - z % d == y - z  (mod d)`. The rest of the proof is done via `by(nonlinear_arith)`.

```rust
pub proof fn lemma_mod_between_helper(x: int, y: int, d: int, small_x:int, small_y:int, tmp1:int) by(integer_ring)
    requires
        small_x == x % d,
        small_y == y % d,
        tmp1 == (small_x - small_y) % d,
    ensures
        (tmp1 - (x-y)) % d == 0
{}

// note that below two facts are from the helper function, and the rest are done by `by(nonlinear_arith)`.
// x % d - y % d == x - y  (mod d)
// y % d - z % d == y - z  (mod d)
pub proof fn lemma_mod_between(d: int, x: int, y: int, z: int) by(nonlinear_arith)
    requires
        d > 0,
        x % d < y % d,
        y - x <= d,
        x <= z < y
    ensures
        x % d <= z % d < y % d
{
    let small_x = x % d;
    let small_y = y % d;
    let small_z = z % d;
    let tmp1 = (small_x - small_z) % d;
    lemma_mod_between_helper(x,z,d, small_x, small_z, tmp1);

    let tmp2 = (small_z - small_y) % d;
    lemma_mod_between_helper(z,y,d, small_z, small_y, tmp2);    
}
```


#### Example 2: Proving properties on bounded integers with the help of `integer_ring`

Since `integer_ring` proofs only support `int`, you need to include explicit bounds when you want to prove properties about bounded integers. For example, as shown below, in order to use the proof `lemma_mod_after_mul` on `u32`s, `lemma_mod_after_mul_u32` must ensure that all arguments are within the proper bounds before passing them to `lemma_mod_after_mul`.  

If a necessary bound (e.g., `m > 0`) is not included, Verus will fail to verify the proof.

```rust
proof fn lemma_mod_after_mul(x: int, y: int, z: int, m: int) by (integer_ring)
    requires (x-y) % m == 0
    ensures (x*z - y*z) % m == 0
{}

proof fn lemma_mod_after_mul_u32(x: u32, y: u32 , z: u32, m: u32)   
    requires
        m > 0,
        (x-y) % (m as int) == 0,
        x >= y,
        x <= 0xffff,
        y <= 0xffff,
        z <= 0xffff,
        m <= 0xffff,
    ensures (x*z - y*z) % (m as int) == 0
{ 
  lemma_mod_after_mul(x as int, y as int, z as int, m as int);
  // rest of proof body omitted for space
}
```

The desired property for `nat` can be proved similarly.

The next example is similar, but note that we introduce several additional variables(`ab`, `bc`, and `abc`) to help with the integer_ring proof.

```rust
pub proof fn multiple_offsed_mod_gt_0_helper(a: int, b: int, c: int, ac: int, bc: int, abc: int) by (integer_ring)
    requires
        ac == a % c,
        bc == b % c,
        abc == (a - b) % c,
    ensures (ac - bc - abc) % c == 0
{}

pub proof fn multiple_offsed_mod_gt_0(a: nat, b: nat, c: nat) by (nonlinear_arith) 
    requires
        a > b,
        c > 0,
        b % c == 0,
        a % c > 0,
    ensures (a - b) % (c as int) > 0
{
    multiple_offsed_mod_gt_0_helper(
      a as int, 
      b as int, 
      c as int, 
      (a % c) as int, 
      (b % c) as int, 
      ((a - b) % (c as int)) as int
    );
}
```
