# Unwinding signature

For any `exec`-mdoe function, it is possible to specify whether that function may [unwind](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/unwinding.html). The allowed forms of the signature are:

 * No signature (default) - This means the function may unwind.
 * `no_unwind` - This means the function may not unwind.
 * `no_unwind when {boolean expression in the input arguments}` - _If_ the given condition holds, then the call is guaranteed to not unwind.
    * `no_unwind when true` is equivalent to `no_unwind`
    * `no_unwind when false` is equivalent to the default behavior

By default, a function is allowed to unwind. (Note, though, that Verus _does_
rule out common sources of unwinding, such as integer overflow, even when the function
signature technically allows unwinding.)

## Example

Suppose you want to write a function which takes an index, and that you want to specify:

 * The function will execute normally if the index is in-bounds
 * The function will unwind otherwise

You might write it like this:

```rust
fn get(&self, i: usize) -> (res: T)
    ensures i < self.len() && res == self[i]
    no_unwind when i < self.len()
```

This effectively says:

 * If `i < self.len()`, then the function will not unwind.
 * If the function returns normally, then `i < self.len()` (equivalently, if `i >= self.len()`, then the function must unwind).

## Restrictions with invariants

You cannot unwind when an [invariant](https://verus-lang.github.io/verus/verusdoc/vstd/macro.open_local_invariant.html) is open.
This restriction is necessary because an unwinding operation does not necessarily abort a program.
Rust allows a program to ["catch" an unwind](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html), for example, or there might be other threads to continue execution.
As a result, Verus cannot permit the program to exit an invariant-block early without restoring
the invariant, not even for unwinding.

This is restriction is what enables Verus to rule out [exception safety violations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exception-safety.html).

## Drops

If you implement `Drop` for a type, you are required to give it a signature of `no_unwind`.
