# Verifying a container library

In this section, we'll learn how to verify a simple container library, specifically,
via an example of a _map_ data structure implemented using a binary search tree.
In the case study, we'll explore various considerations for
writing a modular specification
that encapsulates verification details as well as implementation details.
