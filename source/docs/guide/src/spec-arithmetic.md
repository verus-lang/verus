# Arithmetic

Basic arithmetic operators and functions usable in spec expressions are
described in [Integers and arithmetic](./integers.md).

The standard library includes the following additional arithmetic functions
usable in spec expressions:
* Exponentiation (`vstd::arithmetic::power::pow`)
* Power of two (`vstd::arithmetic::power2::pow2`)
* Integer logarithm (`vstd::arithmetic::logarithm::log`)
