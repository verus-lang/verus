# Libraries

The Verus standard library, `vstd`, comes with a variety of utilities and
datatypes for proofs, as well as runtime functionality with specifications.
Most Verus programs will start with `use vstd::prelude::*;`, which pulls
in a default set of definitions that we find generally useful.  This chapter
will introduce a few of them, but you can find more complete descriptions
in the [vstd documentation](https://verus-lang.github.io/verus/verusdoc/vstd/).
