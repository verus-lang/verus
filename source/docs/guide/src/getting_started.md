# Getting Started

In this chapter, we'll walk you through setting up Verus and running it on a sample program.
You can either:

 * [Install Verus and run it from the command line](./getting_started_cmd_line.md)
 * [Install Verus and run it from within VSCode](./getting_started_vscode.md)

If you don't want to install Verus yet, but just want to experiment with it or follow
along the tutorial, you can also run Verus through [the Verus playground](https://play.verus-lang.org/) in your browser.
