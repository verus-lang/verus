# Feature status

The content in this document applies only to Verus's **experimental** new mutable reference support,
which can be enabled with the Verus command line option `-V new-mut-ref`.

If you're familiar with the old design, see [migration-mut-ref.md](./migration-mut-ref.md)
for more information on the transition and migration issues.

# Mutable references

For simple uses of mutable references—i.e., within a single function, and without involving
loops—Verus's proof strategy can usually track mutable references precisely and without much trouble. 
For example:

```rust
fn example1() {
    let mut a = 0;
    let a_ref = &mut a;

    *a_ref = 5;

    assert(a == 5);
}
```

Or:

```rust
fn example1() {
    let mut a = Some(0);

    match a {
        Some(inner_ref) => {
            // Obtain a reference to the contents of the Option
            *inner_ref = 20;
        }
        None => { }
    }

    assert(a == 20);
}
```

For more complex examples, we often need to write specifications about mutable references.
In the rest of the section, we'll see how to do that.

## Function specifications

One of the most common ways to work with mutable references is to have a function taking
a mutable reference as an argument. In this case, we usually need a specification that relates
the "input" value (i.e., the value behind the reference at the beginning of the function)
to the "output" (i.e., the value behind the reference at the end of the function).

```rust
fn add_1(x: &mut u8)
    requires *x < 255
    ensures *final(x) == *old(x) + 1
{
    *x += 1;
}
```

In the precondition, we use `*x` to refer to the value behind the mutable reference at the
beginning of the function. (In this case, we use the precondition to prevent overflow from the
addition operator.)
In the postcondition, we refer to both the input value (via `old`) and the output value
(via `final`).

> **Aside: Could we just use `*x` in the postcondition?**
> 
> Strictly speaking, `*x` in a specification will always refer to the value pointed to by `x`
> at the _beginning_ of the function.
> This is because `x` is an input parameter, so just like any other input parameter, it is always
> evaluated with respect to its value at call time.
>
> However, we also anticipate that this might be confusing to the untrained eye—intuitively,
> one might expect `*x` to refer to the updated value when it is used in the postcondition.
> Thus, Verus currently requires the developer to disambiguate by writing `old(x)`.
>
> _Historically_, Verus did once allow `*x` in the postcondition, where it referred to the updated
> value. However, this special case turned out to be incompatible with the formal theory
> that Verus later adopted, so this feature was removed.

## Returning mutable borrows

Let's do a more complex example, with a function that _returns_ a mutable reference.
Specifically, let's write a function that takes a `&mut (A, B)` as input and return a mutable
reference to the first field: `&mut A`.

```rust
fn get_mut_fst<A, B>(pair: &mut (A, B)) -> (ret: &mut A)
    requires ???
    ensures ???
{
    &mut pair.0
}

fn test() {
    let mut p = (10, 20);

    let r = get_mut_fst(&mut p);
    *r = 100;

    assert(p == (100, 20));
}
```
