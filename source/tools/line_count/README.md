# Trusted / Proof / Code line accounting

This accounts Verus lines in a project by whether they are
* part of the trusted system specification,
* executable code, or
* proof text.

## Known issues

To run this, first run `verus` on a project with `--emit=dep-info`. This will output a `.d` file in the
current working directory. Then run this tool with
```
cargo run --release -- path_to.d -p
```
You will need a shell not configured for `vargo` to be able to run cargo directly.

With the `-p` option you can inspect the project source to see how each line is accounted.
`Spec`, `Proof`, `Exec` are lines with that mode (with some imprecision due to the fact that
this accounting is purely syntactic and some lines aren't purely one mode). Lines that contain
both `Exec` and `Proof` code are accounted separately.
`Trusted` are all the lines in files, modules, items marked with `#[verus::trusted]` and should be
the system and environment specification (i.e. what needs to be manually inspected by an auditor).
Other lines are other definitions and directives, whitespace and mostly-whitespace lines (`Layout`)
and `Comment`s.

At the end of the output, there is a table with a summary per-file and totals. To only print the table
remove the `-p` option.

By default we only count items inside the `verus!` macro, and items marked `#[verified::verify]`.
You can set `--no-external-by-default` to count everything in the crate. There are also local overrides:

* `#[verus::line_count::ignore]` ignores an item in the line count (it becomes unaccounted);
* `#[verus::line_count::consider]` enables counting for an item that would otherwise be ignored.

Finally even more manual overrides are available:

* you can mark a single line with a comment containing the string `$line_count$<list of categories>$` where `<list of categories>` is a comma separated list of categories to apply to that line (which is typically only one), for example `$line_count$Proof$` marks a line as Proof'
* you can mark a block using `$line_count$<list of categories>${$` (at the start of the block) and
`$line_count$}$` at the end of the block.

By default lines that only contain delimiters are accounted as the enclosing context. If you would like to consider them as layout lines instead, use `--delimiters-are-layout`.

Please use `-p` to check that the overrides are being applied correctly.
