# Tips for Contributing to Verus

Thanks for contributing to Verus!  Verus is an Open Source project and welcomes
contributions.  Please report issues or start discussions here on GitHub.

## Editing the Source Code of Verus

You should make sure that your check-out of `rust` is up to date.
Use the `./tools/update-rust.sh` script from the project root.

Before committing any changes to the source code,
make sure that it conforms to the `rustfmt` tool's guidelines.
We are using the default `rustfmt` settings from the Rust repository.
To check the source code, type the following from the `source` directory:

```
../rust/install/bin/cargo-fmt -- --check
```

If you have other toolchains installed (with `rustup`) this will run the active
toolchain by default, and not the `rust-fmt` that we compiled with the `rust` compiler.

To switch to the correct tools, you can add the custom toolchain to `rustup`, and set an
override for this project:

```
cd ..
## In the project root:
rustup toolchain link rust-verify rust/install/
rustup override set rust-verify
```

If the source code follows the guidelines, `cargo-fmt -- --check` will produce no output.
Otherwise, it will report suggestions on how to reformat the source code.

To automatically apply these suggestions to the source code, type:

```
../rust/install/bin/cargo-fmt
```

## Code Documentation

Commenting the code is strongly encouraged.  Use `///` to create comments
that [`rustdoc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html) can
automatically extract into HTML documentation.

The rustdoc (verusdoc) for `main` is automatically published
[ðŸ“– here](https://verus-lang.github.io/verus/verusdoc/lib/) (if the build succeeds).

You can compile the current documentation by running (in the `verify` directory)
```
RUSTC=../rust/install/bin/rustc RUSTDOC=../rust/install/bin/rustdoc ../rust/install/bin/cargo doc 
```
which will produce documentation files, e.g., `./target/doc/rust_verify/index.html`

## Contributing to the Guide

A work-in-progress tutorial and reference document is automatically published
[ðŸ“– here](https://verus-lang.github.io/verus/guide/) from the sources in
[`source/docs/guide`](./source/docs/guide).

## Running tests for the Rust to VIR translation, and inspecting the resulting vir/air/smt

`cargo test` will run the tests for `rust_verify`,

```
RUSTC=../rust/install/bin/rustc ../rust/install/bin/cargo test -p rust_verify
```

As discussed above, you may only need the RUSTC variable on macOS/Linux.

You can run a single test file and a specific test within with the following:

```
RUSTC=../rust/install/bin/rustc ../rust/install/bin/cargo test -p rust_verify --test <test file> <test name>
```

See the cargo help for more info on the test flags.

If you'd like to inspect the vir/air/smt produced by a test, you can provide a target directory path as an
environment variable, `VERIFY_LOG_IR_PATH`.
You should only run a single test, as only the latest logged IR is preserved.
For example, the following will emit the vir/air/smt logs to `rust_verify/logs`:

```
VERIFY_LOG_IR_PATH="logs" RUSTC=../rust/install/bin/rustc ../rust/install/bin/cargo test -p rust_verify --test refs -- test_ref_0
```

If you need to pass additional command-line arguments to the verifier in tests, for example to print the
erased rust ast, you can use the `VERIFY_EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable, like this:

```
VERIFY_EXTRA_ARGS="--print-erased-spec" RUSTC=../rust/install/bin/rustc ../rust/install/bin/cargo test -p rust_verify --test refs -- --nocapture test_ref_0
```
